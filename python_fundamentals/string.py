#A string is simply a list of characters in order 
# 'hello' actually is a list of H E L L O referenced together 
# there are no limits to the number of characters you can have in a string 

#There are three ways that you can regerence a string in python: 

#single double, or triple quotes 
#You can use backlash commands for escape characters to allow a quotation to be included inside a string
